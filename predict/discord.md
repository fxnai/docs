Boost your Discord servers with AI predictions. {% .text-2xl .text-gray-500 .font-normal %}

Function provides a bot that can make predictions right in your Discord server, using slash commands. Here's a quick primer:

## Installing Function Bot
You can install Function in your Discord server using the following link:

{% quick-link title="Make Predictions in Discord" icon="/discord.svg" newTab=true href="https://fxn.ai/discord" description="Make predictions in any conversation with the `/predict` slash command." /%}
{% /quick-links %}

Doing so will ask you to authorize `fxnbot` to join your server:
