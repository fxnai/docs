Function provides a bot that can make predictions right in your Reddit threads. Here's a quick primer:

## Inviting Function to your Subreddit
If you have a restricted or private subreddit, you'll need to invite `/u/fxnbot` to your subreddit:

{% quick-link title="/u/fxnbot" icon="/icon.png" newTab=true href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fxnbot" description="Function bot on Reddit." /%}
{% /quick-links %}

## Logging in on Reddit
Next, you need to authenticate so that Function knows what predictors you have access to. Function authenticates you using your Reddit username. First, head over to [Reddit](https://reddit.com) and grab your username.

Next, head over to your [Account](https://fxn.ai/account) page on Function and paste in your Reddit username:

## Making Predictions
First, we'll need a predictor to make predictions with. You can either use a public predictor on Function, or make your own. In this guide, we'll be using the `@samplefxn/stable-diffusion` predictor:
