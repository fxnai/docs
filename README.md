# Function Docs

![function logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxnai/.github/main/logo_wide.png)

The Function documentation, used both internally and by our users. View at [docs.fxn.ai](https://docs.fxn.ai).

## Design Goals
Our documentation is written to achieve very specific goals. In descending order of priority:

1. **Reduce time-to-first-dopamine**. We want devs to land on [docs.fxn.ai](https://docs.fxn.ai), and be able to make a prediction within the first 1-2 pages.

2. **Extremely accessible**. A core part of our company's thesis is expanding who we call a "developer". In addition to serving hi-tech data and ML teams, we want to appeal to less technical individuals and teams. This means that we assume that our readers are not as familiar with some of the terms we refer to.

3. **Highly visual**. What's better than a giant paragraph? An animated GIF. And what's better than an animated GIF? A live, interactive demo.

4. **Single source of truth**. This serves as the single knowledge base for both our customers *and our internal Function team*. We want to keep almost no internal documentation on the Function platform, separate from these docs.

5. **Collaborative**. We want to welcome our users' changes and suggestions to our docs. This is a major motivation in using Markdown as our content format, and open-sourcing the docs themselves.

## Collaborating
There are a few ways to collaborate:
- **[Open an issue](https://github.com/fxnai/docs/issues)**. Let us know your challenges, suggestions, and recommendations.
- **Fork the docs**. And open a PR with your changes. Someone on the team wil review promptly.
- **Discuss with us [on Discord](https://fxn.ai/community)**. Come tell us your thoughts!
